            <p>Movie reviews help users decide if the movie is worth their time.
            A summary of all reviews for a movie can help users make this decision
            by not wasting their time reading all reviews. Movie-rating websites
            are often used by critics to post comments and rate movies which help
            viewers decide if the movie is worth watching.

            Sentiment analysis can
            determine the attitude of critics depending on their reviews. Sentiment 
            analysis of a movie review can rate how positive or negative a movie review is 
            and hence the overall rating for a movie. Therefore, the process of understanding 
            if a review is positive or negative can be automated as the machine learns through training and testing the data. </p>
